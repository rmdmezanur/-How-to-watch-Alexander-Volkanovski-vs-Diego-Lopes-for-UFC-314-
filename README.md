# -How-to-watch-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-for-UFC-314-

the 12th of April 2025 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The bout is for the vacant UFC featherweight title following Ilia Topuria's vacating the belt to ascend to 155. Both fighters will have some motivation in this matchup, with Volkanovski trying to return to his old self and Lopes shooting for his first title in the UFC.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who reigned for more than four years and made five successful title defenses. But he’s also coming off two straight knockout losses — the first to Islam Makhachev in October 2023 at lightweight and the second to Ilia Topuria in February 2024 at featherweight. That will be his first fight in more than a year after a 14-month layoff.
Motivation: Volkanovski is 36 and has indicated this might be his final opportunity to get his belt back. He has adopted an “Old Man Volk” persona, keen to show he can still scrap with the best of them. He is still confident he will outlast younger sticky-wicket challengers with experience and guile.

Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) has won five straight, including wins over Dan Ige and Brian Ortega. Lopes, who is known for his aggressive style and knockout power, has quickly climbed the featherweight ladder since making his UFC debut less than two years ago.
Fighting Style: Lopes is a powerful striker with elite jiu-jitsu skills, making him a dangerous threat regardless of where the fight takes place. However, concerns about his cardio have stuck around, although he did improve in his most recent fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: experts are expecting a Volkanovski, taking all of Lopes' steam out, using his footwork and tactical approach to grind Lopes cardio into the ground. Staying out of early exchanges along the boundary where Lopes is most dangerous will be critical, because Volkanovski’s durability has been questioned after back-to-back knockout losses.
For Lopes: Lopes needs to capitalize on Volkanovski's recent troubles by pressuring early and using his power. His knack for interspersing striking with grappling also could give Volkanovski trouble.
Highlights
The UFC 314 card is one of the year’s most stacked events:
Co-Main Event: Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett in a lightweight fight.
Featured bouts also include Yair Rodriguez vs. Patricio Pitbull (featherweight), Jean Silva vs. Bryce Mitchell (featherweight) and Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates (welterweight).
It is a clash of eras in both the most literal and abstract sense: Volkanovski’s experience and legacy versus Lopes’ youthful momentum and desire for gold. Not only will the result decide the next featherweight champion, but the outcome could also shape the course of both fighters' careers.
